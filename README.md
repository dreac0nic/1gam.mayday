PROJECT MAYDAY [1GAM.5.2015]
===========================

Project MAYDAY is a late May 2015 #1GAM attempt. The entire goal of this project
purely to learn a bit about Unity 5, get back into the habit of game development,
and have some fun building a game "by the seat of your pants." While there is not much
info now, the game will hopefully grow as it is put together.

## Description
Project MAYDAY is a First-Person adventure game. The goal is to create a semi-surreal
environment for the player to explore. While at this point in time the implementation
of combat is not yet known, it is highly likely that there will be some amount of combat
for the player to engage in.

### Goals
The goals of the project are used to keep track of development objectives and milestones.
These should be used as a tool to create an engaging and creative experience, not
limitations for the developer.

#### Baselines
These are some of the most basic goals for the project based on the original concept.
Hopefully this listing guides in future development choices.

 * First-Person Perspective
 * Interesting Environment (Possibly generated?)
 * Some form of combat
 * Player choice in engagement (sneaky, up-front, etc)
 * Rewarding exploration (Game elements, not petty rewards)

#### Priorities
While the baselines are used to guide the beginning and creation of future game goals,
the priorities are what guide decisions such as what game goals stay and which ones
get trashed.

 1. Crisp and fluid player control and interaction
 2. Approachable Game
     * Intuitive UI
     * Intruiging Environment (Visually, Conceptually)
     * High reliability and predictability (Bugs breaking player engagement first)
 3. Interactive environment, giving the player the chance to emerse themselves
 4. Gameplay choices (Non-confrontal, made by gameplay decisions)
 5. Replayability
